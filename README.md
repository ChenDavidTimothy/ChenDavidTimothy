# David Timothy

Master's student in Computational Engineering at TU Darmstadt, building open-source tools for trajectory optimization and control systems.

## What I Build

**[MAPTOR](https://github.com/maptor/maptor)** - A Python framework for trajectory and design optimization using pseudospectral methods with adaptive mesh refinement. Handles everything from parallel parking and manipulators to spacecraft missions.

I work on trajectory optimization problems where you need to find the best path while simultaneously optimizing system parameters - like sizing rocket engines while planning ascent trajectories, or choosing actuator capacities while planning robot motion.

## Recent Projects

**eVTOL Landing Optimization** (Bachelor Thesis)  
Built a simulation framework for efficient eVTOL aircraft landing missions with dynamic collision avoidance using direct multiple shooting with CasADi.

**Nonlinear Model Predictive Control**  
Implemented NMPC for vertical rocket landing simulation using CasADi and Python.

**Previous Work**: Parallel parking trajectory optimization, drone pathfinding with Grey Wolf Optimization, sensor data analysis for automotive research at TU Darmstadt's Institute for Mechatronic Systems.

## Technical Stack

**Languages**: Python (advanced), MATLAB/Simulink (advanced), Julia (intermediate), C/C++ (learning)  
**Optimization**: CasADi, IPOPT, trajectory optimization, optimal control, model predictive control  
**Tools**: Git, LaTeX, Siemens NX
